This class is a 1-night workshop running from 6:30-9:30pm.  

Do you hear everyone talking about Flexbox but have yet to dive in yourself? Have you briefly experimented but find yourself surprised by the results? 

Flexbox, or Flexible Box Model, is a set of CSS3 properties for creating a flexible layout. By allowing a set of elements to behave predictably when accommodating various screen sizes and devices, Flexbox solves many of the layout issues developers have been struggling with for years! The days of hacks like floats and positioning are numbered as Flexbox allows us to achieve layouts simply and with cleaner code. With support in all modern browsers / IE10+ and just a few tools and strategies for older browsers, it is possible to start using Flexbox today. 

We will cover: 

• Flexbox syntax and how it requires us to think about layout in new ways  
• Flexbox properties and how they work  
• How Flexbox distributes space and and behaves for flexibility in layouts  
• How to decide if it makes sense to use Flexbox in your current project
